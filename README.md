# Battleships Game

![Mockup]

This is a classic Battleships game with 1 player only against the computer. I had fun making this game, however, due to the issues with Codeanywhere I had to work on this code offline in VS Code.

## How to Play
1. The game board is set up with a grid of 10x10.
2. 4 ships is placed on the board.
3. The player inputs their guess by writing rows + column (e.g. "A6" or "C3")
4. The player has 5 attempts to strike down the battleships.
5. If the player runs out of attempts the game will close and show "Game over!".
6. If the player wins the game will show "Good job! You won!"
